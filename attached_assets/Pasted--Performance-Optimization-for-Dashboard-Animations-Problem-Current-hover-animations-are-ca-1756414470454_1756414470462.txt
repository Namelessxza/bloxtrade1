## Performance Optimization for Dashboard Animations

**Problem:** Current hover animations are causing performance lag and stuttering, impacting user experience.

**Optimization Requirements:**

**Reduce Animation Complexity:**
- Remove heavy transform animations (scale, rotate, complex movements)
- Replace complex animations with simple opacity and color transitions
- Limit animations to 2-3 properties maximum per element
- Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties (width, height, margin)

**Implement Performance-First Animation Strategy:**
- Use `transform` and `opacity` only (these are GPU-accelerated)
- Avoid animating `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, or `background-position`
- Replace heavy box-shadows with subtle `border` or `outline` changes
- Use `will-change` property sparingly and remove after animation completes

**Optimize Animation Timing:**
- Reduce animation duration to 200ms or less for hover effects
- Use `ease-out` timing function for snappy, responsive feel
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
- Add animation delays only where absolutely necessary

**Efficient CSS Practices:**
- Use `transform: translateZ(0)` or `transform: translate3d(0,0,0)` to force GPU acceleration
- Avoid animating multiple elements simultaneously on hover
- Implement `pointer-events: none` during animations when needed
- Use CSS `contain` property to isolate animation effects

**Smart Animation Selection:**
- Keep subtle hover effects on primary interactive elements only
- Remove animations from frequently hovered areas (like navigation)
- Focus animations on call-to-action buttons and cards
- Replace complex animations with simple color/opacity fades

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Ensure 60fps performance on average hardware
- Test on lower-end devices and browsers
- Prioritize immediate visual feedback over elaborate effects

Transform the current animation-heavy interface into a smooth, performant experience that still feels polished and engaging.
